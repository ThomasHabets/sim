# Privacy policy

This privacy policy is needed for the app, and applies to it. If not using the
app, then no data leaves your control.

## App

If you use the cloud as a comms channel then IP addresses may be put in short
term logs of the server and of the mobile device, for troubleshooting purposes.

The cloud used may keep graphs of aggregate qps, which will count your requests.

The data is keyed off of a firebase ID the phone gets in order to be able to
receive message. This ID exists in the service for up to 10 minutes after a
request is made, and is then destroyed since it's no longer "in flight".

The content is encrypted with your key, so no other data is exposed to the
service.
