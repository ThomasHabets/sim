# Privacy policy

If you use the cloud as a comms channel then IP addresses may be put in short
term logs of the server and of the mobile device, for troubleshooting purposes.

The cloud used may keep graphs of aggregate qps, which will count your requests.

The data is keyed off of a phone app ID in order to be able to send the message
to the phone. This ID exists in the service for up to 10 minutes after a request
is made, and is then destroyed.

The content is encrypted with your key, so no other data is exposed to the
service.
